More craftsmen will mean more goods in general. Workshops provide more specialized goods and at faster pace. The quality of goods is influenced by the local production quality, while speed of production is influenced by production efficiency."/>
   <string id="kx9hK4SA" text="Villages are similar, though their productions are much more limited. The village's production will largely depend on it's workforce. Various productions, such as farm goods, will depend on it's acreage, meaning that having extra workers over what the land needs will be fruitless. Other productions such as ores depend exclusively on workforce numbers, and are not limited by acreage. Village productions can be expanded by village buildings."/>
   <string id="kB584OYU" text="Population is limited by the settlement's population limit. This limit relies mostly on the local acreage - more useful land will allow more people to fed. Serfs and slaves compose the workforce and make the bulk of labor, including construction and food production. Slaves are usually better in hard labor such as mining, while serfs are more productive as farmers. State slaves contribute to state projects such as construction projects or worforce policies."/>
   <string id="DgUr4orO" text="A quick way of increasing workforce is gathering prisoners and outlaws and turning them into slaves. Keep in mind, slaves are not free, and do not contribute to population growth. Serfs represent the bulk of growth. Increasing population limit and allowing them to grow by themselves is the recommended long term strategy."/>
   <string id="L87e0h2a" text="Food production relies on acreage. Each acre of land requires an amount of workforce. If it is met, the acre will produce food. The output depends on acre type - farmlands are the most productive. When town's stocks are filled, the production will be sold to the market. A town only truly runs out of food when the market is empty, as people will buy it off when their own stocks are empty."/>
   <string id="UNBcpRLu" text="Villages work exactly the same. They will supply town markets by selling their output and thus generating an income. Increasing workforce through population increase is the main method of increasing general food output. However, if workforce saturation is over 100%, it is recommended to focus on acreage expansion instead, as new laborers will not have land to work on."/>

So Mordus watched Orm yoke a fine ox and plough slowly south towards him. And he drank. The sun was setting over the western sea. He drank so much that he didn’t see the ox was ploughing away the mountainside, by the time the ox came close, Mordus was asleep. And so Oca picked up the pace as night fell and charged right at the sleeping Mordus and cut him to pieces. In the morning light, Orm was horrified. There stood Oca, a giant ox, drinking wine from Mordus’ corpse. It had spilled into the furrow made the day before. Orm shouted at Oca: “I asked you to plough away the body of Mordus but here you are drinking up my wine.”, to which the go replied: “No. This is the wine thou hast promised me. But thou gavest it to Mordus. Now I plough no more. Every summer I will come back and drink this wine, and thou shalt have nothing more from the gods. Instead, beest happy with what thou havest.

   <string id="4sC3k7fO" text="Code of Asera"/>
   <string id="CoLCEywd" text="Founded by the immediate sons of the legendary patriarch of the Southlands, the Code of Asera forms the basis of philosophy, art and law among the members of the confederated Aserai tribes. All tribesmen of the Aserai who do not wander as bedouin, are assumed to be followers of the Code of Asera - though only those who seek to study the intricacies of the mythic patrilineal bloodline and its influence upon the world are celebrated and viewed as Sons of Asera; a facet of colloquial nomenclature meant to force camaraderie as all members of the Sultanate make claim to being descendants of Asera. Faqir, akhund, imams, and mushid make up the various levels of clergy who preach the Code and seek to apply its nuanced legalisms and rites to the Southlands. As a whole, those who follow the Code of Asera place an emphasis on charity between communities, vengeance against those who defy precedent or tradition, and mercy given in kindness with justice forced if kindness is scorned."/>
   <string id="uF2hBKKU" text="Do not be as a glutton or a beast; neither hoarding nor bloodlust should color your life. If you take justice into your hands you may find yourself forever grasping for more - allow your betters to guide you as an elder sibling should; do not kill prisoners who have wronged you without their say. But do not reveal yourself to be lax or limp of arm either; for justice will often be your task."/>
   <string id="EFKv7DGi" text="You must never betray the blood of your blood, to do so is to spit upon the Code. If you are called to serve the Aserai, you must shed blood for their cause - at least once, so as to show that you honor your siblings even should you disagree with their choices. You must ensure any who serve you do not suffer the ravages of conflict without justice on your lips and a safe bastion for them to find reprieve in."/>
   <string id="bnfbjMGa" text="…A curious question; though I suppose I would know the deeper answers to this. Few are the faqir or even imam who are as studied in the various things so easily lost in transcription or by cause of would-be sultans seeking to justify their cruelty. The Code does not abide warring between Sons, a facet easily lost and ignored but a point of shame that could tarnish many of our leaders."/>
   <string id="hvuqVf2m" text="It is wise to ask this - we dwell in uncertain times. Greed and rage cloud the hearts of many. Do no harm to the other Sons of Asera; the villagers should never fear your blade in these lands. Do not rob them of their wealth, even if the Sultan demands it - you must be charitable, you are their sibling."/>
   <string id="spy2ujFu" text="…And in weakness, do not allow others to usurp your station. Rebellion, sedition, betrayal - anathema to the Code of Asera. Brother shall not strike against brother, least of all by a knife in the back or by rousing a mob with vicious words or common strife. Suffer not rebellion, for to allow it to foment in the first place speaks to the immensity of your failings. All the pointless bloodshed which may come from such will tarnish you eternal, such that you may find yourself denied Heaven - condemned to an agony of your own making."/>
   <string id="itzfxuQ9" text="Be mindful also of the company you keep, for though all among the Aserai are as brothers - and even the Jawwal and Bedouin are as our cousins; those beyond our blood lineage may not understand your purpose. They may lead you from the path, away from the Code; away from the good of the Aserai. But perhaps I speak this in fear - the long toll of the Empire upon our culture."/>
   <string id="hmkcSU3i" text="To not seek vengeance against those who have attacked your holdings, besieged your homes, murdered your people - is a greater shame. No doctrine of peace can outweigh the Code of Asera in this regard. Many such debts need to be paid, and it is horrifying that our rulers so often choose to forget this. The serpent which bites you and slithers away does not leave you in peace; only when the serpent is crushed, maimed, unable to bite you again does it depart in peace."/>
   <string id="8b9Qad8j" text="When you are called by your brothers, you must come to them; you must serve beside them, you must never fail them if it is in your power. Know also that keeping the company of those outside the Code of Asera will surely corrupt you - you are your brother’s keeper, and they in turn yours. For good or for ill."/>
   <string id="NiDTPPz2" text="Know that I tolerate your presence on behalf of my blooded siblings in the Banu, and though you may desire to coax me with honeyed words or threats of coercion - know also that I am beyond your grasp. I am the Murshid of [Placename], and my word guides the Sultanate by the reading of the Code of Asera. Speak truthfully and with no deceit, lest I denounce your lineage and see them flayed to the last."/>
   <string id="gw31Xmny" text="Peace be upon you, outlander. May you walk with the safety of Asera while you dwell in the company of his sons - and while you walk the lands where his Code is law.

   <string id="fvJt4aTX" text="Peace be to you, outlander. You do not carry yourself as a Son of Asera, so I shall forgive your ignorance - provided you come here in search of wisdom.

It is good to see you are alive and that you are in good health; for the world is rife with conflict beyond our brotherhood and little is to be held as certain.

   <string id="aXDpgcsg" text="Had I the time to do so, I might honor your request and observe the oath you must take to become the blood of my blood - but you lack decorum. Perhaps if you were a wayward prince or a lord of the Jawwal I would consider this my righteous task."/>

   <string id="EofwaHJQ" text="I preach the glory of Asera, our progenitor of legend. I preach lessons learned from the treasury of wisdom he has granted us as his children.

   <string id="3sxQsTy7" text="I preach that which is hidden in poetics of Nahasi dialects and in the riddles of converts stolen away by Darshi slavers in generations past.

   <string id="cDU19QLK" text="I preach the Code of Asera, the backbone of our society, the soul of our nation. For we are all Sons of Asera in these lands, and it is through the patriarch’s example that we go forth in honor and bring glory to his legacy."/>
   <string id="QfQjwGLe" text="I ensure they remember that they are as siblings to the lowliest beggar or the most jackal-thirsting Jawwal marauder; that they must always express love towards that which is good and revile the roguery that leads the soul towards wicked deeds."/>
   <string id="nRiRiRA6" text="I preach that our future shall be as luminous as the sun and as enduring as the Nahasa, so long as we remain united, so long as we are charitable, so long as we welcome even the Jawwal to embrace the Code as their own guiding path in life!"/>
   <string id="EYkmpAva" text="I preach that we should question the nature of goodness and of wisdom; for a good man would not claim to be wise, and a wise man not claim to be good."/>
   <string id="B9XBmvyy" text="We are those who adhere to tradition but know also the struggle to move beyond the belligerence of the past - we are no Jawwal, after all."/>
   <string id="cWg41iew" text="You come before me, like a wriggling eel slithering to a master archer and asking to learn to wield the bow.

When you see that which is evil, you must change it by whatever force you can - if not your hands, then your heart, if not your heart, then your words."/>
   <string id="gToavgYL" text="A common question among the devout and misguided alike; for how can one truly be assured they walk the righteous path? We know not until the end comes and we are weighed against the deeds of our progenitor; but I shall guide you with what wisdom I can."/>
   <string id="DXwkpjeQ" text="Consider your actions and why it is you perform them. If you are of influence, do you wield this power for the good of your siblings or do you take it for your own aggrandizement? When your people starve, do you feast? Do you turn to the sword? Is blood spilled for bread gained a worthy trade?"/>
   <string id="u0iwuK22" text="It does my heart kindly to hear you wish to prove your faith. We live in an age of lip service by most - though I hold no blame to the common man for this; they show their adherence and their faith in their daily labors. If you wish to prove your faith and your adherence to doctrine, you must be a soul who knows peace and who adheres to hierarchy."/>
   <string id="duyNvFEg" text="Seek to improve the lives of even the least of your people and you shall make kings of them all; and know that should you find yourself poorer and your servants richer that you are a better sibling than many of your blood.

   <string id="4zEWWVpe" text="Foremost in my viewing, as a man of the cities of our lands; is the act of almsgiving. We are as keepers to our brothers, to our sisters and siblings; and only a cruel soul would let the blood of their blood starve.You are only as pure as the lowest among us, and thus you purify yourself of sin when you seek to uplift the whole of the Aserai."/>
   <string id="kM7O8NK3" text="If you seek to prove your faith, you must internalize the Code of Asera - you must learn and accept that you are but one of his Sons - and you must seek to bring forth a better world for your children to inherit.

Now worshiped throughout the Southern Empire and in hidden cells of far flung holdings, the Darusosian Martyrdom preach the divine mandate that enshrines the rulership of the line of Arenicos.

He saw the Empire as united in soul and in spirit, undone from within only by the actions of wicked men.

It is only through Empress Rhagaea Pethros and the heir Ira Pethros - that this holy line continues. History should not repeat itself further.No more heroes of our Empire need die for the vanity of lesser men or savage nationals.Darusos awaits us in heaven, and paradise is awarded to those who seek to better the lives of his citizens, and enact the reforms he was denied in life."/>
